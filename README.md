# Application Installation Scripts for ConfigMgr Current Branch

This repository houses some of the scripts I have used to automate installations via ConfigMgr. Within the folders of this repository, you will find various pieces of software and installation scripts. Each software folder has a README which will guide you through, at a high level, of where to obtain the installation files, how to use the scripts provided, and how to instruct ConfigMgr to detect the presence of the installed application.

Use these scripts as you see fit for your own use. If you have any suggestions for improvement to the scripts, feel free to submit an issue or pull request.
